In this sample you will implement a grocery store cash register. Given a number of items you will be required to calculate the total bill. Items are priced a few of different ways:

A given price for each item, eg. Boxes of Cheerios are $6.99 each

A given price by weight, eg. Apples are $2.49 per pound

Items can be on sale, where you might receive bulk discounts, eg. Buy two get one free sales.

Coupons are also available to get money off the bill when the total amount is above a threshold, eg.$5 off when you spend $100 or more

The goal of this exercise is to evaluate your coding style and OO design skills. Please send us a zip file of all the source code and project files


Assumptions-

Create a Point of sales system.

Connection to a backend so that # of items sold and quantity is persistent.
